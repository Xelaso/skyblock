11:05:14 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §bFiremage_X§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
11:05:17 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fI'll keep crunching on those ice cubes, maybe I am missing something.
11:05:17 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fI found an unexplored cave while mining for titanium. But it's too dark to see in there, even for me! Can you spare any glowing pumpkins?
11:05:20 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fWell then, I will even mine in total darkness if I must!
11:05:21 §e[NPC] §aShaggy§f: §r§fHey kid, I haven't seen you in a while. Arachne's powers are growing day by day. Soon she'll take over the §cSpider's Den§f.
11:05:25 §e[NPC] §aShaggy§f: §r§fI wish peace upon you.
11:05:25 §e[NPC] §9Rusty§f: §rEver wondered how I find all the things that other players lost? I outsource it. Right now, someone is looking for their §9Enchanted Melon Block§f. Can you find that for me?
11:05:29 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §rYou seem new here. You should probably try to get some §aEnchanted Pumpkin §ffor me.
11:05:32 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
11:06:03 §e[NPC] §9Rusty§f: §r§fThere we go, a job well done. I'll make sure to leave a good review for you!
