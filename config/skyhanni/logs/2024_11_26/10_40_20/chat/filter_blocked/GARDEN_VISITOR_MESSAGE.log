10:42:32 §e[NPC] §9Rusty§f: §rEver wondered how I find all the things that other players lost? I outsource it. Right now, someone is looking for their §aEnchanted Pumpkin§f. Can you find that for me?
10:42:37 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fExploring the whole wide world makes me hungry, I could take some fresh potatoes.
10:42:39 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fDarn it, I'll have to find another farmer then.
10:42:40 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fI usually only work with Oil Barrels, but I'd like to try making some Biofuel from compost.
10:42:43 §e[NPC] §9Old Man Garry§f: §r§fPeople have no manners these days. They come up to me, and disappear instantly! They don't even greet me! Back in my day, we were raised better than that.
10:42:47 §e[NPC] §aJack§f: §r§fDid you know that you gain additional §6☘ Farming Fortune §fwhile on the §aThe Garden§f? You can check it in your SkyBlock Profile!

10:43:23 §e[NPC] §9Rusty§f: §r§fThere we go, a job well done. I'll make sure to leave a good review for you!
10:43:24 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fOil Barrels are far superior, but at least this is 100% renewable. Pretty neat!
10:43:26 §e[NPC] §9Old Man Garry§f: §r§fIt turns out, manners haven't all been lost yet.
