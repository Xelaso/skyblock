14:45:26 §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fHey! I am looking to make some Hot Potato Books to enhance some of my weapons, do you have any potatoes to spare?
14:45:30 §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fToo bad, I guess I'll have to look for actual metal next time...
14:45:30 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fI found an unexplored cave while mining for titanium. But it's too dark to see in there, even for me! Can you spare any glowing pumpkins?
14:45:32 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fWell then, I will even mine in total darkness if I must!
14:45:33 §e[NPC] §aXalx§f: §r§fHello gardener, I've been looking for some sugar to grow my new crop. Wanna try it?
14:45:36 §e[NPC] §aXalx§f: §r§fSmart choice.
14:45:37 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fThe amount of plots you can unlock here is perfect for a Co-op. So much space!
14:45:40 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fDon't worry, I'll come back later.
14:45:40 §e[NPC] §9Pete§f: §r§fHorror stories are better when you have something to snack on y'know? If you help us gather some ingredients, we could roast some tasty marshmallows.
14:45:44 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fMy wheat minion has been slacking recently, I am thinking about giving it an upgrade. He hasn't produced any wheat in years! Every time I check on him, he's empty.
14:45:46 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fI guess I'll have to keep going like this.
14:46:08 §e[NPC] §9Pete§f: §r§fThanks Pal! Why don't you sit around the campfire with us and enjoy these tasty treats?
16:03:36 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fI want to make some new brews, do you think you can give me some ingredients to work with?
