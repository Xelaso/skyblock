23:35:27 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fI'm planning to head back into the gorge to fetch my hiker friend, but I'll need some meat to cook before I head in there.
23:35:29 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fThat's alright. I can always head into the Oasis to hunt down some sheep.
23:35:31 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
23:35:36 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI guess I'll have to turn up empty-handed.
23:35:36 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fMortal, the time of reckoning is near. The Past will light the future.
23:35:38 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fSoon.
23:35:40 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fSadly you can't gather logs in the §aThe Garden§f, however there are plenty of crops here!
23:35:49 §e[NPC] §6Madame Eleanor Q. Goldsworth III§f: §r§fI'm here to put a value on your farm. Bring me your fanciest crop.
23:36:11 §e[NPC] §6Madame Eleanor Q. Goldsworth III§f: §rTruly Magnificent! I value your farm at a minimum of §6110,000,100 §fcoins!
23:36:15 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fUntil next time!
23:36:16 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
23:36:31 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fAmazing! I haven't eaten such chocolatey goodness in a long time...Maybe they should invest in that rusty old lift.
