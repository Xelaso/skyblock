14:14:20 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fIf you ever get lost, you should check on the Desk on what to do next.
14:14:22 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
14:14:23 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fI heard you have a composter in your barn, it happens to run on the same fuel drills run on! Could I check it out?

15:36:48 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fI have a big problem. I lost my sense of taste, now I can't tell the difference between a melon and a cactus...
15:36:51 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fMy wheat minion has been slacking recently, I am thinking about giving it an upgrade. He hasn't produced any wheat in years! Every time I check on him, he's empty.

15:37:51 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fHoly Macaroni! That should boost my minion to at least Tier 5! Thank you a lot!
15:37:53 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fThanks. That should help me fix my water troubles.
