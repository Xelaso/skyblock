17:02:41 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §rYou seem new here. You should probably try to get some §aEnchanted Golden Carrot §ffor me.
17:02:43 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
17:02:44 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fI'm planning to head back into the gorge to fetch my hiker friend, but I'll need some meat to cook before I head in there.
17:02:49 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fThat's alright. I can always head into the Oasis to hunt down some sheep.
17:02:49 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
17:03:46 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fI once dumped a magical water bucket into the toilet. It won't stop overflowing. Anyway, you got something for me?
17:03:58 §e[NPC] §aFelix§f: §r§fYou won't be able to store any items in the Garden, you should keep them on your Private Island!
17:04:01 §e[NPC] §aFelix§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
17:04:15 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fAmazing! I haven't eaten such chocolatey goodness in a long time...Maybe they should invest in that rusty old lift.
17:04:17 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fThanks. That should help me fix my water troubles.
17:46:00 §e[NPC] §9Old Man Garry§f: §r§fPeople have no manners these days. They come up to me, and disappear instantly! They don't even greet me! Back in my day, we were raised better than that.
17:46:05 §e[NPC] §aJamie§f: §r§fYou might have noticed that you can purchase additional plots within your Desk in the Barn!
17:46:07 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fMortal, the time of reckoning is near. The Past will light the future.
