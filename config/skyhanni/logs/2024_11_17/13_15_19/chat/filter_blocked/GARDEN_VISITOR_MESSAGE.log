14:00:02 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fMy wheat minion has been slacking recently, I am thinking about giving it an upgrade. He hasn't produced any wheat in years! Every time I check on him, he's empty.
14:00:04 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fI guess I'll have to keep going like this.
14:00:05 §e[NPC] §aTom§f: §r§fI don't have a recipe for you, however I'd happily take some crops.
14:00:07 §e[NPC] §aTom§f: §r§fNo problem, see ya next time!
14:00:08 §e[NPC] §9Queen Mismyla§f: §r§fThe King made me go grocery shopping. Me! Can you believe that? He has a pair of perfectly good legs, and still, here I am.
14:00:21 §e[NPC] §9Queen Mismyla§f: §r§fI bet when I am back, they are all still sitting around that table! All day, every day! It's ludicrous!
14:00:22 §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fHeard you may got some mushrooms...I've been looking for some...
14:00:34 §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fThank ya man, I knew I could trust you! These will come in good use!
14:00:35 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fSadly you can't gather logs in the §aThe Garden§f, however there are plenty of crops here!
14:00:38 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fHmm, too bad.
