17:27:39 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fI want to make some new brews, do you think you can give me some ingredients to work with?
17:27:43 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fMortal, the time of reckoning is near. The Past will light the future.
17:27:44 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fSoon.
17:27:45 §e[NPC] §aAndrew§f: §rDid you know that SkyBlock has been running for §b4637 §fin-game months already? Time flies.
17:27:46 §e[NPC] §aAndrew§f: §r§fI guess I'll come back in a bit.
17:27:48 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fHard times we are in. Take care!
17:27:51 §e[NPC] §9Shifty§f: §r§fIt seems like my brew selection is rather small...I've recently heard that melon juice is really sought after so maybe it can enhance my drinks' flavors!
17:27:54 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fDo Golden Carrots taste different than normal ones? I've actually never tried one before so I am pretty curious how they taste.
17:27:59 §e[NPC] §aAnita§f: §r§fHey hey hey again! I'll trade you some copper for some carrots!
17:28:02 §e[NPC] §aAnita§f: §r§fOh, darn it :(
17:28:16 §e[NPC] §9Shifty§f: §r§fWell done! I'm sure that even Sirius will enjoy my revolutionary melon refreshments.
17:29:16 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fDo Golden Carrots taste different than normal ones? I've actually never tried one before so I am pretty curious how they taste.
17:29:18 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fLet's taste...THIS IS DISGUSTING!!! Why would anyone waste such precious gold on this? Just like any other fancy food, expensive and gross...
20:37:04 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fIf you ever get lost, you should check on the Desk on what to do next.
20:37:07 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
20:37:07 §e[NPC] §aLibrarian§f: §r§fGreetings! I've been running low on paper recently for my Enchanted Books, could you bring me some Sugar Cane?
20:37:10 §e[NPC] §aLibrarian§f: §r§fVery unfortunate, I really needed that paper...
20:37:11 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fExploring the whole wide world makes me hungry, I could take some fresh potatoes.
20:37:13 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fDarn it, I'll have to find another farmer then.
20:37:13 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Ceanna§f: §r§fThe King's favorite emissary is here to request potatoes for the King's great feast! 
20:37:17 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Carlton§f: §r§fThe King has sent me to go shopping for I am his favorite emissary!
20:37:20 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Wilson§f: §r§fThe King's least favorite vegetable is carrot, so he sent me, his favorite emissary, to make it better!
20:37:44 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Ceanna§f: §r§fMaybe the King will even announce me as his favorite at the feast!
20:37:45 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Carlton§f: §r§fThis will make me gain even more favor with the King!
20:37:46 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Wilson§f: §r§fI'm sure that by giving him his least favorite vegetable, he'll make me his favoritest emissary!
